\chapter{Introduction}
This document starts from an existing architecture of a poker application that was originally designed with only an intuitive idea of security threats for poker applications. By modelling the data flow through the application we try to locate areas that can be subjected to these threats. 

For a subset of entities we apply STRIDE to elicit security threats and we use threat tree patterns to render these threats more concrete. The results are documented as misuse cases.

Finally, we present examples of business threats that cannot be discovered using the STRIDE methodology. 


\chapter{Identifying threats}
\section{DFDs}
Figure \ref{fig:context} shows the context level of the DFD. Figure \ref{fig:level_0} shows the level-0 DFD. The arrows are not annotated to make the diagram readable. A simplified version with only the player and annotated arrows can be found in figure \ref{fig:level_0_player}. In the following analysis only the interaction with the player will be considered as misuse cases, as those with an administrator as external entity are similar. Although some processes are complex and should be drilled down, we've chosen to do the STRIDE analysis on level-0 because it would already generate sufficient documentation.

There are several trust boundaries that can be identified in the DFDs. First of all there is the trust boundary between the external entities and the processes. All input coming from the external entities should be validated and the data flow from the processes to the external entities should be analyzed for not leaking sensitive, private or confidential data. Inside this trust boundary several smaller trust boundaries can be recognized. These are the processes that deal with sensitive, private data: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Account Management:} account data should be protected and all data flowing out of this process should be verified extensively. 
\item \textbf{Table:} hole cards are confidential data only accessible for the player to whom they belong and the game engine to verify the winner at the end of a deal.
\item \textbf{Logging Engine:} the logging should happen in a secure way so there is no possibility to alter the log, therefor the log entries arriving at the logging engine should be validated. The log also contains very sensitive data, so the access is only allowed to a very limited number of entities and processes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rationale}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is an internal policy to restrict physical access to the servers. 
\item There is no protection needed against an administrator with a debugger (can read and alter memory).
\item Side channels aren't available to mis-actors.
\item Data flow from a process to a data store is in our case always local and not subject to threats.
\end{itemize}

\section{Architecture based Misuse Cases}
\subsection{Player}
\label{PlayerCases}
\subsubsection{Spoofing a Player}
\label{PlayerCasesS}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor gains access to the poker server pretending to be a legitimate user. To achieve this goal he can use false credentials or credentials of an existing user. He could also bypass the authentication system to realize the same objective. \\
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor obtains the credentials of a legitimate player.
\item The mis-actor authenticates with the poker server.
\item The mis-actor can take actions on behalf of a legitimate player.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor bypasses the authentication system by exploiting a weakness.
\item The mis-actor finds a way to fake credentials.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure credentials are well protected on the server side.
\item Transmit credentials over the wire securely.
\item Test credentials for uniqueness and complexity.
\item Certify client software to enforce that credentials are handled securely.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Triggers:}\\
Always true, i.e., this can happen at any time. \\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Credentials can be falsified.
\item Credentials are not well protected.
\item There is no authentication system or the authentication system is too weak.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Assumptions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The players are careless with their credentials (e.g. store user name/password in a text file).
\item The players choose easy passwords.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Worst case threat:}\\
The crook can play with the spoofed identity against his own identity and win all chips from spoofed identity. \\
\textbf{Prevention Guarantee:} \\
Only authentic users can gain access at the poker server. \\
\textbf{Stakeholders and risks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Player: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Potential loss of money if his identity is misused and all chips are transfered to an other account.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor spoofs another actor with access to private information (e.g. user names, passwords, ...).
\item The mis-actor uses the private information.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Elevation of privilege of the mis-actor leads to information disclosure.
\item The mis-actor sends invalid input to the poker server.
\item The mis-actor has access to the memory and can alter its state (e.g. debugging mode).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All input is validated.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lobby}
\label{LobbyCases}
\subsubsection{Spoofing a lobby}
\label{LobbyCasesS}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor prepares a process to spoof the lobby and deploys it on one of the online casino servers or on an external server. Every player connecting to a table through the lobby can be diverted to an untrusted table.
\subsubsection{Tampering with the lobby}
\label{LobbyCasesT}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor tampers with the lobby to modify its functionality. A player connecting to a table through the lobby can be diverted to an untrusted table. 
\subsubsection{Repudiation of an action at the lobby}
\label{LobbyCasesR}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The lobby can deny access to a table for a certain user and deny having done so.

\subsubsection{Information disclosure at the lobby}
\label{LobbyCasesI}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor can obtain private information through spoofing or tampering with the lobby process. He could see private tables or tournament settings.

\subsubsection{DoS against the lobby}
\label{LobbyCasesD}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor performs actions leading to a crash or overloading the capacity of the lobby. As a result, the lobby can no longer be reached by the users.
\subsubsection{Elevation of privilege at the lobby}
\label{LobbyCasesE}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor performs actions leading to the possibility to do administrator actions. He can achieve this by presenting false credentials, spoofing an administrator or tampering with the lobby or account management.

\subsection{Table}\
\label{TableCases}
\subsubsection{Spoofing a table}
\label{TableCasesS}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor prepares a process to spoof the table and deploys it on one of the online casino servers or on an external server. Every player connecting to this table can be scammed. The spoofed table could provide the mis-actor with all confidential information or deal crafted hands to maximize the profit of the mis-actor (e.g. deal a full house to an innocent player and deal a four of a kind to himself and lure the innocent player to go all-in).
\subsubsection{Tampering with a table}
\label{TableCasesT}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor tampers with the lobby to modify its functionality. Every player connecting to this table can be scammed. The tampered table could provide the mis-actor with all confidential information or deal crafted hands to maximize the profit of the mis-actor (e.g. deal a full house to an innocent player and deal a four of a kind to himself and lure the innocent player to go all-in).
\subsubsection{Repudiation of an action at a table}
\label{TableCasesR}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The online casino denies a player has won a number of chips or has received certain hole cards. This is possible if there is no log or if the log could be modified. It is also possible that the hand evaluation system has been tampered and this should be detected afterwards. 
\subsubsection{Information disclosure at a table}
\label{TableCasesI}
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor spoofs an other actor with access to private information regarding this table
(e.g. pocket cards of players, ...).
\item The mis-actor uses the private information.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Elevation of privilege of the mis-actor leads to information disclosure.
\item The mis-actor sends invalid input to the table.
\item The mis-actor has access to the memory and can alter its state (e.g. debugging mode).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All input is validated.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Detection:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The behavior of the mis-actor is influenced by the information disclosure. This altered behavior could be detected by examining the logs.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{DoS against a table}
\label{TableCasesD}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor performs actions leading to a crash or overloading the capacity of the table. As a result, the table can no longer be reached by the users.

\subsubsection{Elevation of Privilege at the table}
\label{TableCasesE}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor performs actions leading to the possibility to do administrator actions. He can achieve this by presenting false credentials, spoofing an administrator or tampering with the lobby or account management.

\subsection{Account Management}
\label{AccountManagementCases}

\subsubsection{Spoofing the account management system}
\label{AccountManagementCasesS}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor gains access to the account management system or manages to pretend he is the account management system by obtaining or falsifying credentials. By doing so the mis-actor has control over how incoming requests and data are processed. He can for instance trick other processes in to accepting bad credentials for authentication.

\subsubsection{Tampering with the account management system}
\label{AccountManagementCasesT}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor can tamper with the account management system to always accept credentials for a certain fake user.

\subsubsection{Repudiation of using the account management system}
\label{AccountManagementCasesR}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The casino can deny access to a user in critical moments and deny having done so. When a user changes his credit card number or other personal information the account management system can deny having received that request. When a payment fails afterwards the user cannot seek compensation from the casino.

\subsubsection{Information disclosure of the account management system}
\label{AccountManagementCasesI}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
When the mis-actor corrupts te account management system he can obtain private information such as passwords and credit card numbers. This can be done by through spoofing or tampering with the process.

\subsubsection{DoS against the account management system}
\label{AccountManagementCasesD}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
By sending bad input to the account management system or by sending many requests at once, the mis-user can overload the process. This can result in legitimate users not being able to authenticate with the system or change their account data.

\subsubsection{Elevation of Privilege at the account management system}
\label{AccountManagementCasesE}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
Through spoofing, tampering or exploiting the authorization system, the mis-actor can obtain admin privileges. In the account management system he will be able to e.g. kick or ban opponents.

\subsection{Logging Engine}
\label{LoggingEngineCases}

\subsubsection{Spoofing the logging engine}
\label{LoggingEngineCasesS}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor gains access to the logging engine or manages to pretend to be the logging engine by obtaining or falsifying credentials. This way he can stop logging messages from being made persistent by the real logging engine.

\subsubsection{Tampering with the logging engine}
\label{LoggingEngineCasesT}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor can tamper with the logging engine and send different data to the audit log than was received from other processes. Alternatively, he can send logging data to the audit log that is made up.

\subsubsection{Repudiation of using the logging engine}
\label{LoggingEngineCasesR}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The logging engine can deny having recieved logging data that didn't make it to the physical audit log. The casino can deny that certain audit data was sent from the logging engine and is valid.

\subsubsection{Information disclosure of the logging engine}
\label{LoggingEngineCasesI}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor can obtain private information through spoofing or tampering with the logging process. This way he could e.g. see the hidden cards of an opponent.

\subsubsection{DoS against the logging engine}
\label{LoggingEngineCasesD}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
By sending bad data to the logging engine or by sending many requests at once, the mis-user can overload the process. This can result in valid logging data being lost by the process because it can't store the incoming information.

\subsubsection{Elevation of Privilege at the logging engine}
\label{LoggingEngineCasesE}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
Through spoofing, tampering or exploiting the authorization system, the mis-actor can obtain admin privileges. AS a result he can, for instance, shut down logging.

\subsection{Audit Log}
\label{AuditLogCases}

\subsubsection{Tampering with the audit log}
\label{AuditLogCasesT}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The misuser can tamper with the audit log when he bypasses the protection or monitor, or when he exploits overcapacity failures. The logging data can then be modified or erased.

\subsubsection{Repudiation of logging something in the audit log}
\label{AuditLogCasesR}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor can modify or obscure data in the audit log to be able to repudate certain actions. An auditor will bot be able to deny this allegation.
Also see section \ref{Criticism} for criticism of this threat.

\subsubsection{Information disclosure of the audit log}
\label{AuditLogCasesI}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
When the mis-actor bypasses te protection scheme and the data is weakly encrypted he might be able to obtain logging information. This can e.g be credit card information, transaction information or private cards. Information leakage can also occur when removed data isn't cleared correctly from the data store or when te mis-actor spoofs an entity that has access to the data store.

\subsubsection{DoS against the audit log}
\label{AuditLogCasesD}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
By sending bad data to the audit log (SQL injecton) or by sending many requests at once, the mis-user can overload the data store. This can result in valid logging data being lost because the data store has e.g. run out of memory or disk space.

\subsection{Account Data}
\label{AccountDataCases}

\subsubsection{Tampering with account data}
\label{AccountDataCasesT}
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor gains access to the data store
\item The mis-actor puts data directly in the data store
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor removes data directly from the data store
\item There may be overcapacity failures: the mis-actor floods the data store by placing large 
amounts of data into the data store. As a consequence data in the beginning of the store might be overwritten
, data written to the store might be discarded or the data store might crash, depending on the implementation of
the data store.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item placing and removing of data in the data store is securely logged
\item data store is protected by the internal policies
\item extra-monitor access is impossible (behind a reliable firewall)
\item overcapacity failures are handled accordingly
\item only private or local networks are used for communication between the account management process 
and the account data store.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Detection:}
\begin{itemize}
\item logs can be searched for adding of removing falsified data
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Information disclosure of account data}
\label{AccountDataCasesI}
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor spoofs the account management process
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item encrypting the data 
\item data store is protected by the internal policies
\item extra-monitor access is impossible (behind a reliable firewall)
\item only private or local networks are used for communication between the account management process 
and the account data store.
\item prevent spoofing of account management process
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor gains access to the data store.
\item The mis-actor corrupts the data store by sending invalid input.
\item The data store crashes and becomes unavailable.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor floods the data store by placing large amounts of data into the data store and exceeds the 
capacity of the data store.
\item The mis-actor consumes application-specific resources (e.g. submit more queries per second that the data 
store can handle).
\item The mis-actor injects malicious SQL queries (or other) to an user of the data store. When this injection reaches the data store it crashes.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}

\item Invalid queries are filtered.
\item Data store is protected by the internal policies.
\item Extra-monitor access is impossible (behind a reliable firewall).

\subsection{Data Flows from a Player}
\label{PlayerFlowCases}

According to \cite[p117]{1202957}, one of the first concerns before doing threat analysis should be to reduce the number of entities to analyze.
Here we choose to reduce the number of data flows from/to the Player because interaction between a Player and the different processes is very similar (using the same technology, similar entities with similar confidentiality). We only consider requests for tokens (login actions), actions sent to a process, tokens sent to a Player and events/responses sent to a Player.

\section{Business Logic Misuse Cases}

\subsection{Single player Cheating}
\subsubsection{A player uses multiple accounts to access more confidential information}
\textbf{Summary:} The malicious player uses multiple accounts at the same table. He uses the extra information to  have a more accurate view on the outs\footnote{Any unseen card that, if drawn, will improve a player's hand to one that is likely to win. The number of outs can be converted to the probability of making the hand on the next card.}. He gains an unfair advantage over the other innocent players. \\
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The malicious player creates multiple accounts. 
\item The malicious player is sit-in at a table with different accounts.
\item The malicious player uses the additional knowledge to make statistically more successful decisions. 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each player can have at most 1 account.
\item Limit the number of simultaneous connections from 1 ip-address to 1 account.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Detection:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The behavior of the malicious player is influenced by the extra knowledge. This could lead to inexplicable actions that can only be explained with the knowledge of the pocket cards of the other players. This behavior can be detected by consulting the logs.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{A malicious player with admin rights uses confidential information in a game and act on it}
\textbf{Summary:} If an admin has access to the card info of all the players at a table, he can act on perfect knowledge which is a huge advantage.

\subsubsection{A malicious player misuses the right to ask the admin to view the log of the table}
\textbf{Summary:} The malicious player misuses the possibility to view the table log pretending to be suspicious of collusion. The malicious player can verify the hands of all the opponents, also those who have chosen not to show their cards. By this way he can gain more insight into the strategy of its opponents (whether someone is bluffing or not, ...). Consulting the log is only possible after the game has been played so there is no direct influence, but in the long run gives an unfair advantage and allows profiling of a players behaviour.

\subsubsection{A malicious player can flood the network of another player to force a time-out}
\textbf{Summary:} A malicious player can flood the network of an opponent at a crucial moment so no communication between this opponent and the poker server is possible. This will lead to a time-out of the opponent. Depending on the time-out policy the malicious player can have a huge advantage.

\subsection{Multi player Cheating}
\subsubsection{Collusion}
\textbf{Summary:} Collusion is a secret cooperation of two or more players. By collaborating they have access to more knowledge of hole cards than legitimate. With this extra knowledge they have a more accurate view on the outs. An other advantage that can be achieved through collaboration is the use of a common strategy to maximise their profits. Examples of strategies are: only playing the best hand they have, raise each other to force the other players to call to enlarge the pot. \\
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Unskilled outsiders
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[bp1.] The mis-actors are sit-in at the same table. 
\item[bp2.] The mis-actors communicate their hole cards and tactics through some unmonitored channel.
\item[bp3.] The mis-actors take actions with the extra knowledge.
\item[bp4.] The mis-actors gain an unfair advantage over the honest players.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[ap1.] The mis-actors communicate their hole cards and tactics through a covert channel in a monitored channel. (for bp2.)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item All inter player communication happens through a monitored channel where no covert channel is possible. In a monitored channel all messages are accessible to all the players who have joined a table. All the messages are also logged for audit.
\item Enforcing the use of a webcam is an invasive way to mitigate the use of some unmonitored channels (e.g. phone, same physical location, ...), but it's still possible to use parts of the body that aren't captured to send messages to the other mis-actor or to use a covert channel. It's also possible to spoof the stream of the webcam so countermeasures against this new threat have to be taken into account.
\item The screen can be periodically captured and analysed to ensure no other communicative application is used. The applicability of this method lies only in the scope of the computer that is used. This countermeasure is broken by using an other independent computer to communicate with the other mis-actors.
\item A firewall can be placed to disallow all other communication except the poker client, or filter all network packages for suspicious chat messages. This capture point has the same vulnerability as the previous capture point: it's possible to break this countermeasure by using an other independent computer to communicate with the other mis-actors.
\end{itemize}
A proper risk analysis is needed to find the right trade-off between cost and risk as absolute mitigation of this threat is practically infeasible. 
\item \textbf{Detection:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The game logs are analysed to detect collusion.
\item A player can report suspicious behavior that will be investigated by the online casino.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Reputation is damaged and as a consequence potential loss of revenue.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{An admin collaborates with a player to play with full information disclosure}
\textbf{Summary:} An admin who has access to the hole cards could pass the secret information to a collaborating player. This collaboration leads to perfect information access and a perfect strategy. The collaboration is an attempt to camouflage the cheating of a single administrator. \\
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Insider and a collaborator (malicious player)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[bp1.] The insider joins the table. 
\item[bp2.] The collaborator is sit-in at the table. 
\item[bp3.] The insider has access to the hole card info of all players at the table. 
\item[bp4.] The insider sends the confidential information through an unmonitored channel to the collaborator. 
\item[bp5.] The collaborator takes actions with this extra knowledge. 
\item[bp6.] The collaborators gain an unfair advantage over the honest players.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[ap1.] The insider communicates the hole cards through a covert channel in a monitored channel. (for bp4.)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system enforces administrators have only access to the hole cards after the deal.
\item An administrator can only access the poker server inside the trusted domain of the online casino and he has no means to communicate with the outside world (no phone, firewall, ...).
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Detection:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The game logs are analysed to detect collusion.
\item A player can report suspicious behavior that will be investigated by the online casino.

\textbf{Prevention Guarantee:} \\
The hole cards are never exposed to a player at the poker table. \\
\textbf{Detection Guarantee:} \\
The insider and the collaborator can be detected and appropriate sanctions can be taken. \\
\textbf{Stakeholders and risks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Honest players: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Loss of fairness and as a consequence potential loss of money.
\end{itemize}
\item Online casino: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Reputation is damaged and as a consequence potential loss of revenue.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Malicious player can predict hole and community cards}
\textbf{Summary:} A malicious player can predict the hole and community cards of every deal by deducing the next numbers in the random number generator from the observed cards. The security through obscurity approach for application integrity is unfeasible as the code is open source. \\
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Skilled outsider
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[bp1.] The mis-actor joins the table. 
\item[bp2.] The mis-actor observes the cards dealt at the table.
\item[bp3.] The mis-actor uses the observations to make a model of the current dealer.
\item[bp4.] The mis-actor is sit-in at the table and uses the model to plays with full information access (both hole cards of all players at the table and future community cards).
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[ap1.] The mis-actor searches for the seed used by the random number generator (for bp3.).
\item[ap2.] The mis-actor brakes the random number generator (for bp3).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item A secure random number generator is used for shuffling the cards.
\item A secure distributed shuffling algorithm is used.
\item The seed of the secure random number generation is unpredictable.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Detection:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The game logs are analysed to detect anomalies. 
\item A player can report suspicious behavior that will be investigated by the online casino.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Triggers:}\\
Always true, i.e., this can happen at any time. \\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The seed of the random number generator can be found (e.g. system time, constant value, ...)
\item No secure method for random number generation is used.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Assumptions:} \\
\textbf{Worst case threat:}\\
With all this information the malicious player knows before the hand is played whether he will win or not. This makes it possible to gain a huge amount of chips.\\
\textbf{Prevention Guarantee:} \\
No one can predict the hole and community cards from any deal. \\
\textbf{Detection Guarantee:} \\
The mis-actor can be detected and appropriate sanctions can be taken. \\
\textbf{Stakeholders and risks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Honest players: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Loss of fairness and as a consequence potential loss of money.
\end{itemize}
\item Online casino: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Reputation is damaged and as a consequence potential loss of revenue.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chip dumping}
\textbf{Summary:} Chip dumping is the act of deliberately losing chips (most of the time in a heads-up game) to a known opponent. This can be a way to transfer money from a fraudulent account, set-up with stolen credit cards or other stolen funds to a legitimate account. This can also be an attempt to perform money laundry. If chip dumping happens in a tournament, it is a severe form of cheating since the winner is the player who has the highest stack in the end. \\

\subsubsection{Placing spyware on the computer systems of honest players}
\textbf{Summary:} A malicious player can put spyware on the computer system of honest players. This spyware observes the hole cards of the player and sends this information to the malicious player. As the malicious player has access to more information, he gains an unfair advantage over the honest players. \\

\subsubsection{Altered client provided to the players}
\textbf{Summary:} A malicious player provides a modified client on a website. This client is modified to send hole cards information to the computer system of the malicious player. An innocent player could download this modified client to play on the real poker server, unaware that the client is modified. The malicious player gains an unfair advantage when he is sit-in at the same table as the tricked player.

\section{Simplification}
To reduce the workload and the documentation, only a cohesive selection of components will be secured. The DFD for the simplified version can be found in figure \ref{fig:dfd_level_0_player_simplified}. The simplified deployment view in figure \ref{fig: deployment_simplified}.
This means following components will be omitted for future analysis: Cashier, Lobby and Chat Service. Although some of these components will benefit from the instantiated patterns, potential conflicts could arise if the omitted components would be secured in a future phase.

\section{Quality trade-off labels}
\label{labels}
By analyzing the business goals, we constructed the following ordered list of quality trade-off labels:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Usability: the online casino has to be as easy to use as possible. This quality attribute might seem less important than confidentiality and integrity but in reality cheating will always happen (e.g. collusion) and the loss will be calculated in. When a lot of people play in the online casino because it is te most usable, this cost will be less significant.
\item Confidentiality: it is of the abmost importance that certain information like the cards of a player, remains
confidential.
\item Integrity: no one should be able to compromise the integrity of the application or it's data.
\item Accountability: no player may be able to repudiate any bets or other actions.
\item Manageability: the application must be easy to manage by an admin.
\item Cost: the cost of the application should be reasonable to low, so profit will remain solid.
\item Performance: performance being the possible amount of games played simultaneously, is important because it
determines the maximum profit. It is very easy to come up with solutions to performance problems because of the distributed nature of the application (table are independent).
\item Maintainability: the application should be easy to maintain.
\end{enumerate}
These labels will be used to guide the selection of security patterns in the next section.
\section{Detailed description of the followed steps}
We will use the security patterns and methodology described in \cite{yskout} to select the appropriate patterns
for this application.

\subsection{Analysis Phase}
The analysis phase consists of eliciting the security requirements and annotating each 
security requirement with the security object it belongs to. The requirements have been elicited by the misuse cases
in \ref{TODO}. The annotations to indicate for each requirement to which security objective it belongs to,
are in \ref{TODO}. This is very important, since the succes of the selected methodology heavily depends 
on this list of security requirements.
\subsection{Architecture Phase}
As stated in \cite[p13]{yskout}, the architecture of the system is designed using ADD or Attribute-Driven Design,
meaning it is created based on the non-functional requirements of the application and their relative importance.
Therefore a prioritized list of quality attributes, inspired by the business goals, was formulated under 
\ref{labels}. Then we iterate over the selection of architectural patterns, as it is stated by the methodology.

\subsubsection{Authentication}
The authentication requirement covers the most misuse cases so it is selected as the first requirement to cover.
The following patterns address authentication at the architectural level:
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication Enforcer
\item Credential Tokenizer
\item Security Association
\item Secure Service Facade
\item Session
\item Single Access Point
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Authorization}

\begin{itemize}
\item Authorization Enforcer
\item Controlled Object Monitor
\item Full View With Errors
\item Limited View
\item Secure Service Facade
\item Single Access Point
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application Integrity}

\begin{itemize}
\item Checkpointed System
\item Comparator-Checked Fault-Tolerant System
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Accountability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secure Logger
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Integrity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Session
\item Secure Access Layer
\item Secure Pipe
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Availability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Checkpointed System
\item Load Balancer
\item Replicated System
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Design Phase}
We don't consider design phase and patterns because it isn't part of the assignment and it would be too
low level.
\subsection{System Phase}
As stated in \cite[p13]{yskout}, the architecture of the system is designed using ADD or Attribute-Driven Design,
meaning it is created based on the non-functional requirements of the application and their relative importance.
Therefore a prioritized list of quality attributes, inspired by the business goals, was formulated under 
\ref{labels}. Then we iterate over the selection of architectural patterns, as it is stated by the methodology.

\subsubsection{Authentication}
The authentication requirement covers the most misuse cases so it is selected as the first requirement to cover.
The following patterns address authentication at the architectural level:
\begin{itemize}
\item Container Managed Security
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Authorization}

\begin{itemize}
\item Application Firewall
\item Container Managed Security
\item Controlled Process Creator
\item Controlled Object Factory
\item Demilitarized Zone
\item Firewall
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application Integrity}
No patterns

\subsubsection{Accountability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Audit Interceptor
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Integrity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secure Message Router
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Availability}
No patterns
\subsection{Selected Patterns}
To summarize, here is the list of the selected patterns:
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication Enforcer
\item Authorization Enforcer
\item Secure Pipe
\item Full View with Errors
\item Limited View
\item Application Firewall
\item Firewall
\item Checkpointed System
\item Audit Interceptor
\item Secure Access Layer
\item Load Balancer
\end{itemize}
The following patterns were already used in the application:
\begin{itemize}
\item Credential Tokenizer
\item Secure Service Facade
\item Secure Pipe
\item Secure Logger
\end{itemize}
\section{Criticism}
\label{Criticism}
\begin{itemize}
\item The classification of the threat tree isn't very clear sometimes: e.g. you can tamper with the server process
to spoof the server and thus tampering with the data.
\item The threat three isn't complete; for instance there is nothing in it about spoofing by corruption of 
DNS records.
\item Some business use cases can't be covered with the list of security patterns in the given catalog
\item The list of labels is incomplete for some security patterns in the catalog: e.g. Secure Pipe should also have
the confidentiality-label.
\item Some patterns that are mentioned by other security patterns, aren't listed in the catalog: e.g. Secure Pipe 
benefits from Security Association, but the latter pattern isn't listed in the catalog. Input Guard also isn't
in the list.
\item Repudiaton of processes/data stores that are all internal to the system is very unclear. In the lectures it was said that this was, for instance, the casino denying that it did something. In \cite[p270]{1202957} however it is explained as an external entity tampering with the process/data store to be able to deny having done something. The difference with repudiaton of that external entity is unclear.
\end{itemize}
\section{Log}
\textbf{30-10-2008}
\begin{itemize}
\item We decided to only consider the RMI protocol as communication protocol for the poker application in this 
security analysis, and to not got into depth in the sockets or http protocol. For these protocols, a front-end is added to the architecture that delegates to the different processes also used by RMI.
\item Table communicates with Cashier instead of with Account Management process to obtain an amount of chips
of the main stack of a player and bring it to the table stack of that player.
\item For liability reasons, the log with game details must be made public after a game. This is reflected in some
business threats where a mis-actor might use this to profile certain players.
\item We decided to connect complex process in the Level 0 DFD directly to data stores so whe can apply STRIDE
at this level. Otherwise the number of misuse cases would explode.
\end{itemize}
