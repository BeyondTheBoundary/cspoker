\chapter{Introduction}
This document starts from an existing architecture of a poker application that was originally designed with only an intuitive idea of security threats for poker applications. By modelling the data flow through the application we try to locate areas that can be subjected to these threats. 

For a subset of entities we apply STRIDE to elicit security threats and we use threat tree patterns to render these threats more concrete. The results are documented as misuse cases.

Finally, we present examples of business threats that cannot be discovered using the STRIDE methodology. 


\chapter{Identifying threats}
\section{DFDs}
Figure \ref{fig:context} shows the context level of the DFD. Figure \ref{fig:level_0} shows the level-0 DFD. The arrows are not annotated to make the diagram readable. A simplified version with only the player and annotated arrows can be found in figure \ref{fig:level_0_player}. In the following analysis only the interaction with the player will be considered as misuse cases, as those with an administrator as external entity are similar. Although some processes are complex and should be drilled down, we've chosen to do the STRIDE analysis on level-0 because it would already generate sufficient documentation.

There are several trust boundaries that can be identified in the DFDs. First of all there is the trust boundary between the external entities and the processes. All input coming from the external entities should be validated and the data flow from the processes to the external entities should be analyzed for not leaking sensitive, private or confidential data. Inside this trust boundary several smaller trust boundaries can be recognized. These are the processes that deal with sensitive, private data: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Account Management:} account data should be protected and all data flowing out of this process should be verified extensively. 
\item \textbf{Table:} hole cards are confidential data only accessible for the player to whom they belong and the game engine to verify the winner at the end of a deal.
\item \textbf{Logging Engine:} the logging should happen in a secure way so there is no possibility to alter the log, therefor the log entries arriving at the logging engine should be validated. The log also contains very sensitive data, so the access is only allowed to a very limited number of entities and processes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rationale}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is an internal policy to restrict physical access to the servers. 
\item There is no protection needed against an administrator with a debugger (can read and alter memory).
\item Side channels aren't available to mis-actors.
\end{itemize}

\section{Architecture based Misuse Cases}
\subsection{Player}
\subsubsection{Spoofing a Player}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor gains access to the poker server pretending to be a legitimate user. To achieve this goal he can use false credentials or credentials of an existing user. He could also bypass the authentication system to realize the same objective. \\
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor obtains the credentials of a legitimate player.
\item The mis-actor authenticates with the poker server.
\item The mis-actor can take actions on behalf of a legitimate player.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor bypasses the authentication system by exploiting a weakness.
\item The mis-actor finds a way to fake credentials.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure credentials are well protected on the server side.
\item Transmit credentials over the wire securely.
\item Test credentials for uniqueness and complexity.
\item Certify client software to enforce that credentials are handled securely.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Triggers:}\\
Always true, i.e., this can happen at any time. \\
\textbf{Preconditions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Credentials can be falsified.
\item Credentials are not well protected.
\item There is no authentication system or the authentication system is too weak.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Assumptions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The players are careless with their credentials (e.g. store user name/password in a text file).
\item The players choose easy passwords.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Worst case threat:}\\
The crook can play with the spoofed identity against his own identity and win all chips from spoofed identity. \\
\textbf{Prevention Guarantee:} \\
Only authentic users can gain access at the poker server. \\
\textbf{Stakeholders and risks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Player: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Potential loss of money if his identity is misused and all chips are transfered to an other account.
\end{itemize}
\item Online Casino: 
\begin{itemize}

\subsubsection{Spoofing a table}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor prepares a process to spoof the table and deploys it on one of the online casino servers or on an external server. Every player connecting to this table can be scammed. The spoofed table could provide the mis-actor with all confidential information or deal crafted hands to maximize the profit of the mis-actor (e.g. deal a full house to an innocent player and deal a four of a kind to himself and lure the innocent player to go all-in).
\subsubsection{Tampering with a table}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The mis-actor tampers with the lobby to modify its functionality. Every player connecting to this table can be scammed. The tampered table could provide the mis-actor with all confidential information or deal crafted hands to maximize the profit of the mis-actor (e.g. deal a full house to an innocent player and deal a four of a kind to himself and lure the innocent player to go all-in).
\subsubsection{Repudiation of a table}
\textbf{Summary:} \\
The online casino denies a player has won a number of chips or has received certain hole cards. This is possible if there is no log or if the log could be modified. It is also possible that the hand evaluation system has been tampered and this should be detected afterwards.

amounts of data into the data store. As a consequence data in the beginning of the store might be overwritten
, data written to the store might be discarded or the data store might crash, depending on the implementation of
the data store.

\subsection{Data Flows from a Player}

According to \cite[p117]{1202957}, one of the first concerns before doing threat analysis should be to reduce the number of entities to analyze.
Here we choose to reduce the number of data flows from/to the Player because interaction between a Player and the different processes is very similar (using the same technology, similar entities with similar confidentiality). We only consider requests for tokens (login actions), actions sent to a process, tokens sent to a Player and events/responses sent to a Player.

\item The Player cannot perform actions. For example, this can lead to timeouts where the server folds on behalf of a non-responsive player, giving an unfair advantage to the mis-actor.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor consumes resources required by the Player or process.
\item The mis-actor corrupts the actions.
\item The mis-actor preplays actions, making them unavailable for a Player.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prevent tampering, spoofing and DOS of the endpoints and data flow.
\item Limit the number of resources the process depends on.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Denial of Service of responses and events}
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor incapacitates the channel by incapacitating the Player or process.
\item The Player cannot receive events/responses.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor consumes resources required by the Player or process.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Prevent tampering, spoofing and DOS of the endpoints and data flow.
\item Limit the number of resources the process depends on.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Flows to Logging Engine}
\subsubsection{Tampering with logging requests}
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor find a weakness in the integrity of logging requests.
\item The mis-actor intercepts a logging request sent by another process.
\item The mis-actor replays the logging request to duplicate the thing to be logged.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor spoofs another Player to send fake logging requests.
\item The mis-actor performs a MITM attack and eavesdrop on the logging requests sent by a genuine process.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use antireplay defences and a strong message and channel integrity algorithm.
\item Prevent spoofing of processes.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Information Disclosure of logging requests}
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor finds a weakness in the confidentiality of logging requests and the channel used to send them.
\item The mis-actor observes which process wants to log something and what they want to log.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor sets up a MITM attack.
\item The mis-actor observes data through a side channel.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use stong message confidentiality.
\item Use strong channel confidentiality.
\item Review known side channel vulnerabilities to determine if they apply and fix them.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Denial of Service of logging requests}
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor incapacitates the channel by incapacitating the Logging Engine.
\item No process cannot log things.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Alternative paths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The mis-actor consumes resources required by other processes.
\item The mis-actor corrupts the logging requests.
\item The mis-actor preplays logging requests, making that functionality unavailable for other processes.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}

\section{Business Logic Misuse Cases}
\subsection{Single player Cheating}
\subsubsection{A player uses multiple accounts to access more confidential information}
\textbf{Summary:} The malicious player uses multiple accounts at the same table. He uses the extra information to  have a more accurate view on the outs\footnote{Any unseen card that, if drawn, will improve a player's hand to one that is likely to win. The number of outs can be converted to the probability of making the hand on the next card.}. He gains an unfair advantage over the other innocent players. \\
\textbf{Primary mis-actor:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Crook
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic path:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The malicious player creates multiple accounts. 
\item The malicious player is sit-in at a table with different accounts.
\item The malicious player uses the additional knowledge to make statistically more successful decisions. 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Capture points:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prevention:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Each player can have at most 1 account.
\item Limit the number of simultaneous connections from 1 ip-address to 1 account.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Detection:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The behavior of the malicious player is influenced by the extra knowledge. This could lead to inexplicable actions that can only be explained with the knowledge of the pocket cards of the other players. This behavior can be detected by consulting the logs.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{A malicious player with admin rights uses confidential information in a game and act on it}
\textbf{Summary:} If an admin has access to the card info of all the players at a table, he can act on perfect knowledge which is a huge advantage.

\subsubsection{A malicious player misuses the right to ask the admin to view the log of the table}
\textbf{Summary:} The malicious player misuses the possibility to view the table log pretending to be suspicious of collusion. The malicious player can verify the hands of all the opponents, also those who have chosen not to show their cards. By this way he can gain more insight into the strategy of its opponents (whether someone is bluffing or not, ...). Consulting the log is only possible after the game has been played so there is no direct influence, but in the long run gives an unfair advantage and allows profiling of a players behaviour.

\subsubsection{A malicious player can flood the network of another player to force a time-out}
\textbf{Summary:} A malicious player can flood the network of an opponent at a crucial moment so no communication between this opponent and the poker server is possible. This will lead to a time-out of the opponent. Depending on the time-out policy the malicious player can have a huge advantage.

\subsection{Multi player Cheating}
\subsubsection{Multiple players at a table collaborate}
\textbf{Summary:} By collaborating they have access to more knowledge than legitimate. With this extra knowledge they have a more accurate view on the outs. They can protect each other, or they can raise each other to force the other players to call higher chip amounts to enlarge the pot.
\subsubsection{An admin collaborates with a player to play with full information disclosure}
\textbf{Summary:} An admin who has access to the pocket cards could pass the secret information to a collaborating player. This collaboration leads to perfect information access and a perfect strategy. The collaboration is an attempt to camouflage the cheating.

\section{Criticism}
\begin{itemize}
\item The classification of the threat three isn't very clear sometimes: e.g. you can tamper with the server process
to spoof the server and thus tampering with the data.
\item The threat three isn't complete; for instance there is nothing in it about spoofing by corruption of 
DNS records.
\item Some business use cases can't be covered with the list of security patterns in the given catalog
\item The list of labels is incomplete for some security patterns in the catalog: e.g. Secure Pipe should also have
the confidentiality-label.
\item Some patterns that are mentioned by other security patterns, aren't listed in the catalog: e.g. Secure Pipe 
benefits from Security Association, but the latter pattern isn't listed in the catalog.
\end{itemize}

\section{Log}
\textbf{30-10-2008}
\begin{itemize}
\item We decided to only consider the RMI protocol as communication protocol for the poker application in this 
security analysis, and to not got into depth in the sockets or http protocol. For these protocols, a front-end is added to the architecture that delegates to the different processes also used by RMI.
\item Table communicates with Cashier instead of with Account Management process to obtain an amount of chips
of the main stack of a player and bring it to the table stack of that player.
\item For liability reasons, the log with game details must be made public after a game. This is reflected in some
business threats where a mis-actor might use this to profile certain players.
\item We decided to connect complex process in the Level 0 DFD directly to data stores so whe can apply STRIDE
at this level. Otherwise the number of misuse cases would explode.
\end{itemize}
