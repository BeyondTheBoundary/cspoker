	abstract = {Architectural patterns are a key concept in the field of software architecture: they offer
well-established solutions to architectural problems, help to document the architectural
design decisions, facilitate communication between stakeholders through a common vocabulary,
and describe the quality attributes of a software system as forces. Regrettably,
finding and applying the appropriate architectural patterns in practice still remains largely
ad-hoc and unsystematic. This is due to the lack of consensus in the community with
respect to the “philosophy” and granularity of architectural patterns, as well as the lack
of a coherent pattern language. In this paper we attempt to establish common ground in
the architectural patterns community by proposing a pattern language that acts as a superset
of the existing architectural pattern collections and categorizations. This language is
particularly focused on establishing the relationships between the patterns and performs a
categorization based on the concept of “architectural views”.},
